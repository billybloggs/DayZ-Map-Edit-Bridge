# DayZ-Map-Edit-Bridge
copy of init.c


this is a copy of the init.c
the bridge is loaded from here.
you may add more items to list under the void main()
you only need //Spawn helper function once at top of init.c

this is a basic init.c if you have edited yours you need edit this or copy paste changes

Always make backups :) Before changing anything.
